        <p>Hey there, my name is Jake Hayes and thanks for visiting my website! I just graduated from The Ohio State University on May 7, 2017 with a B.S. in Geographic Information Science and a minor in Design. College has not been typical for me at all. During these last five years, I have been a collegiate athlete, I have transferred schools and gotten married. I started my freshman year at Taylor University with a scholarship to play football. I played football through middle and high school and it was just natural for me to continue in college. As a quarterback, I was able to learn a lot about leadership and dealing with stress both on and off the field. However, after a year at Taylor I decided it was no longer the place for me and I transferred to the best university in the world, Ohio State. Here, I started as a computer science major and ended up changing majors to GIS. Between transferring and changing majors, I ended up adding a fifth year of college. This has actually been a blessing as it has provided me the opportunity to work at Apple, Inc. As an at home advisor, I have been able to be trained to troubleshoot the iPhone, iPad and Mac. I have been working at this job for just over three years now. While in college, I actually married my high school sweetheart. I met her in middle school and we would have never imagined getting married to each other almost ten years later. These last five years have been full of transition and change but I am welcoming the opportunity to enter the work force and to begin my career. Please feel free to go back to the home page to explore design projects that I have created, programming languages and codes that I am familiar with and other things I have done.</p>
